        //1. create your scanner object
        //object name can be anything)

        //fix1=Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in); (this should not give error, ask to someone)

        //2.prompt the user for putting input
        System.out.println(" put your name : ");
        //.3. get the input

       // fix2= name = input.next(); //reads data from console and assingns the value to my variable
        //input also shoud not give error. ask
        //4. use the value that i read

        System.out.println("name = "+ name);


        // steps one and three mus but steps 2 and four depends on the situation
        //wwe need to import scanner class from java utitlities
        //import java.util.Scanner; you put this statement at tthe top of your page beforre class
